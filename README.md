# Course description
<a name="description"/>

This course will consider some large questions surrounding ethics in artificial intelligence systems. These questions include:

- Do computers make decisions in a way that is more fair and less biased than people?

- What are the political, legal, social, economic and technological forces that govern the digital world? Which forces are in opposition? Which forces are aligned?

- What role does the government currently play in directing AI technology in the United States? What role *could* the government play? What are the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches?

# Grading
<a name="grading"/>

Your grade will be based equally on the following:

- **50%** Online reading responses. Each week in this course you will write an online response to the readings on Moodle. You must turn in your response *before* class to receive credit for the week. 
- **50%** Participation during class discussions. This class will have weekly in-class discussions. Different students may participate in different ways: for instance by talking in large groups, talking in small groups or listening carefully to others.

# Class policies
<a name="policies"/>
